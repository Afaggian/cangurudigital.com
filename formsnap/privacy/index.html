<main>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Canguru Digital ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use the FormSnap mobile application ("the App"). By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect the following types of information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you register, we collect your email address and a hashed password via Firebase Authentication.</li>
    <li><strong>Scanned Data:</strong> Images captured using the camera are processed to extract form field data (e.g., names, addresses, phone numbers). Extracted data is stored on our secure servers to enable review, editing, and export.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect anonymised data about how you use the App (screens visited, features used) to improve the product.</li>
    <li><strong>Purchase Information:</strong> Subscription transactions are handled by Apple and RevenueCat. We do not store your payment details.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide and operate the App's core features (scanning, reviewing, exporting contacts)</li>
    <li>To authenticate your account and maintain session security</li>
    <li>To process and fulfil in-app subscription purchases</li>
    <li>To improve app performance and fix bugs</li>
    <li>To respond to support requests</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Camera and Photo Access</h2>
  <p>The App requires access to your device's camera to capture images of forms. Images are transmitted securely to our servers for processing. We do not share your images with third parties and do not use them for advertising or profiling purposes.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your personal data. We may share data with trusted third-party services solely to operate the App:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Firebase (Google):</strong> Authentication and analytics</li>
    <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Subscription management</li>
    <li><strong>Google Cloud:</strong> Secure backend infrastructure</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain your account data and scanned sessions for as long as your account is active. You may delete your account and all associated data at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@cangurudigital.com">support@cangurudigital.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>We use industry-standard encryption (HTTPS/TLS) for all data in transit and store data on secure Google Cloud infrastructure. Access to production systems is restricted to authorised personnel only.</p>

  <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can delete it.</p>

  <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on your location, you may have the right to access, correct, or delete the personal data we hold about you. To exercise any of these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@cangurudigital.com">support@cangurudigital.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes by updating the date at the top of this page. Continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
